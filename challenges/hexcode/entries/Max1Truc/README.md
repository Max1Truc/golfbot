# All hex codes in good old Brainfuck, by Max1Truc

The most readable file is hexcodes.bf and the minified one is hexcodes.min.bf

It was reduced using `bfo.exe o5 hexcodes.bf hexcodes.min.bf`

There is also a hexprint.bf file, whose code permits to print the number in cell 0, from 0 to 15, in hexadecimal.
